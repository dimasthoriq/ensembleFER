# Running the Experiment
* You can download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TOiNfQdH8GVWcNBC9v_YktuwXCbdLuq-) and inside the ensembleFER.ipynb notebook
* You can download the trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DFo9738zbmV1MJ2h5tQzO3BEk-Iulf4i) and inside the ensembleFER.ipynb notebook
* The notebook was made on Google Colab and it is strongly advised to run the experiment under the Colab environment
* You can open the Colab notebook from this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ssc930UmTXBqlF0JMkIio6IYtDZJ3h0J#scrollTo=HldvGAUHme0g) or download and run the ensembleFER.ipynb to your local
* Happy experimenting! :D
